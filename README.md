  ## Description
  This application is Google Chrome Extension that shows the user all Seattle concerts over the next 30 days in a decrete dropdown panel.
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: This application JavaScript, HTML, API, and CSS.
  <br><br>
  I created the basic extension along with a tutorial cited below in the credit section. I then adapted the code to show the user 30 days out from today's date. I also included code to show and reformat the date of the event and add pictures. Last I added CSS to style the data. 
  <br><br>
  In the future, I would like to add hyperlinks to more information or to purchase tickets. It would also be interesting to include a reminder feature.
